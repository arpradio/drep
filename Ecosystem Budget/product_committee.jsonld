    "comment": "Community input on the development of Cardano has been implemented in various ways on the Blockchain.  Our governance process allows ideas to be presented and vetted with community input.  While criticisms on the current approaches have been made, it seems the underlying belief of the proposer is that there is a lack of community input in the development and roadmap of Cardano. which is perceived as harmful to the ecosystem.  While it may seem true, analyzing the basis of this reveals, in my analysis, that the community's list of wants may or may not always match the capabilities of the developers/blockchain.  \n\nOur current method of vetting ideas seems to work better than directly engaging the community- I reject the idea that engaging the community alone creates a better direction for a decentralized ecosystem to follow.
