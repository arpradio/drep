    "comment": "Cexplorer.io remains a widely used tool and is one that is greatly beneficial.  However, the proposal, in my view, is far too vague for there to be a functional administration.  The proposal aims to fund long term sustainability yet fails to provide any milestones nor a breakdown of overhead that would provide data to suggest a long-term plan of sustainability would be achieved with the funds received.\n\nI believe trust in administration can only be obtained with defined processes within the proposal stage, as no further community control is afforded after passing.  Therefore, even well intentioned, yet deserving entities not reaching this threshold of trust may not be funded without it."
