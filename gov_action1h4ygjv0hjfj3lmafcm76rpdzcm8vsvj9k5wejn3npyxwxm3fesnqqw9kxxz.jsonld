    "comment": "It is clear the community feels the inclusion of this node is overall beneficial to the Cardano Community.  However, administration of the budget is an aspect that needs to be clearly defined prior to a proposal.  If the mechanism for administering this budget is not clearly defined, how can we properly determine it is sufficient?  This sets a precedent for future proposals to have text that may present promises yet have no means of qualification.  In my opinion, the administration of the budget remains one of the best suppliers of confidence within a community, and though I support the project in principle, administration should never be compromised."
